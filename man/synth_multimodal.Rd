\arguments{
\item{n.cases}{Integer: Number of cases to create.}

\item{init.fn}{Character: "runifmat" or "rnormmat". Use the respective functions to
generate features as random uniform and random normal variables, respectively.}

\item{init.fn.params}{Named list with arguments "min", "max" for "runifmat" and
"mean", "sd" for "rnormmat".}

\item{n.groups}{Integer: Number of feature groups / modalities to create.}

\item{n.feat.per.group}{Integer, vector, length \code{n.groups}: Number of features per group to create.}

\item{contrib.p}{Float (0, 1]: Ratio of features contributing to outcome per group.
a third of the features in each group will be used to produce the outcome y}

\item{linear.p}{Float [0, 1]: Ratio of contributing features to be included linearly.
features in each group will be included}

\item{square.p}{Float [0, 1]: Ratio of contributing features to be squared.
in each group will be squared}

\item{atan.p}{Float [0, 1]: Ratio of contributing features whose \code{atan} will be used. These will be selected
from the features that were NOT sampled for squaring.
i.e. .1 of .33 of features in each group will be transformed using \code{atan}, but given these features were not
already picked to be squared (see \code{square.p})}

\item{pair.multiply.p}{Float [0, 1] Ratio of features will be divided into pairs and multiplied.}

\item{pair.square.p}{Float [0, 1] Ratio of features which will be divided into pairs, multiplied and squared.}

\item{pair.atan.p}{Float [0, 1] Ratio of features which will be divided into pairs, multiplied and transformed using
\code{atan}.}

\item{verbosity}{Integer: Verbosity level.}

\item{seed}{Integer: If set, pass to \code{set.seed} for reproducibility}

\item{filename}{Character: Path to file to save output.}
