Advanced Machine Learning made easy, efficient, reproducible

\section{Online Documentation and Vignettes}{

}

\section{System Setup}{

There are some options you can define in your .Rprofile (usually found in your home directory),
so you do not have to define each time you execute a function.
\describe{
   \item{rt.theme}{General plotting theme; set to e.g. "whiteigrid" or "darkgraygrid"}
   \item{rtCores}{Number of cores to use. By default, rtemis will use available cores reported by
   parallelly::availableCores(). In shared systems, you should limit this as appropriate.}
}
}

\section{Visualization}{

Static graphics are handled using the \code{mplot3} family.
Dynamic graphics are handled using the \code{dplot3} family.
}

\section{Supervised Learning}{

Functions for Regression and Classification begin with \code{s.*}.
Run \link{modSelect} to get a list of available algorithms
The documentation of each supervised learning function indicates in brackets, after the title
whether the function supports classification, regression, and survival analysis \code{[C, R, S]}
}

\section{Clustering}{

Functions for Clustering begin with \code{u.*}.
Run \link{clustSelect} to get a list of available algorithms
}

\section{Decomposition}{

Functions for Decomposition and Dimensionality reduction begin with \code{d.*}.
Run \link{decomSelect} to get a list of available algorithms
}

\section{Cross-Decomposition}{

Functions for Cross-Decomposition begin with \code{x.*}.
Run \link{xdecomSelect} to get a list of available algorithms
}

\section{Meta-Modeling}{

Meta models are trained using \code{meta*} functions.
}

\section{Notes}{

Function documentation includes input type (e.g. "String", "Integer", "Float", etc) and
range in interval notation where applicable. For example, Float: [0, 1)" means floats between 0 and 1 including 0,
but excluding 1

For all classification models, the outcome should be provided as a factor, with the first level
of the factor being the 'positive' class, if applicable. A character vector supplied as outcome
will be converted to factors, where by default the levels are set alphabetically and therefore
the positive class may not be set correctly.
