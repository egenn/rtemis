\usage{
delay_time(
  bpm = 120,
  note = c("2", "1", "1/2", "1/2T", "1/4D", "1/4", "1/4T", "1/8D", "1/8", "1/8T",
    "1/16D", "1/16", "1/16T", "1/32D", "1/32", "1/32T"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bpm}{Integer: Beats per minute. Default = 120}

\item{note}{Character: Delay/Reverb time in note duration: "2", "1", "1/2",
"1/2T", "1/4D", "1/4", "1/4T", "1/8D", "1/8", "1/8T", "1/16D", "1/16",
"1/16T", "1/32D", "1/32", "1/32T".
"2" means a double note, "1" a whole, and so on. "T" denotes a triple note,
"D" denotes a dotted note.
Case insensitive. Default = "1/4" (quarter note)}
